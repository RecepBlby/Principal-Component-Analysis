is an unsupervised, non-parametric statistical technique primarily used for dimensionality reduction in machine learning. High dimensionality means that the dataset has a large number of features. The primary problem associated with high-dimensionality in the machine learning field is model overfitting, which reduces the ability to generalize beyond the examples in the training set.
